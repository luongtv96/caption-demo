1
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,033
Welcome! Welcome!

2
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,203
Congrats, Drac.
Holy smokes, everybody's here.

3
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:04,416
Mr and Mrs Loughran,
the parents of the groom, and family.

4
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,880
-Mom and Dad!
-Johnny!

5
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,090
I can't believe you're all here.

6
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,864
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

7
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,784
Yo, how hot is my date?

8
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,577
So hot.

9
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,830
-How 'bout how hot mine is?
-You got a date?

10
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah. She's invisible.
That's why you can't see her.

11
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,003
Right. This is the one from "Canada"?

12
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,213
Wedding's starting.

13
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,481
Great.

14
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,491
True. So true, Marty.

15
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,382
How sweet.

16
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,138
My. Look at you.

17
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,557
My gosh.

18
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,116
Is it everything you wanted,
my little poisonberry?

19
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,910
It is, Daddy.

20
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,454
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

21
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,374
Honey, your gramps
would not have been cool with this.

22
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,834
He's old-school.

23
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,378
How do we know?
If he could just meet Johnny...

24
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,921
He would have eaten him.

25
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,007
He's not as enlightened as your hip Daddy.

26
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,177
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

27
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,890
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

28
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,184
Thanks, Dad.

29
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,731
And you'll always be my moonlight

30
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,402
But now on wings of love you soar

31
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,572
Now that you're Johnny's girl

32
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,115
Johnny's girl

33
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,701
And kind of Daddy's, too

34
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,578
Your mom would be so happy

35
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,746
'Cause she always knew

36
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,169
Love is making room for all the best in you

37
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,690
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, guys!

38
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,483
Todd, take a break.

39
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,280
So, what's up?

40
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,909
Mavis was wondering
if maybe you wanted to go for a fly.

41
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,121
We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

42
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,290
No special reason at all.

43
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,417
Right, Mavey?

44
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,420
-What's his deal?
-He's silly.

45
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,631
It's just a beautiful night, and...

46
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,257
Well, if you don't want to...

47
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,759
No, no! Are you kidding?

48
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,595
I would eat a bucket of garlic to fly with you.

49
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,508
Honey, look at those fluffy clouds.

50
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,303
Remember what we played
when you were little?

51
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,681
Hide and Go Seek Sharp Objects?

52
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,352
Okay. Regular Hide and Go Seek.

53
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,356
Where are you?

54
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,527
Honeybat!

55
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,780
Mavey!

56
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,033
Honeybat!

57
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,704
I'm gonna get you.

58
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,336
Honey? Are you okay?

59
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,549
Yes. It's just a little harder
to catch my breath since I'm pregnant.

60
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,385
Yes, well, I guess that would make it more...

61
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,469
What?

62
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,188
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

63
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,901
And I'm gonna be a dad!

64
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,155
'Cause you're Daddy's girl, or boy

65
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,741
Daddy's girl, or boy

66
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,868
I'm hungry again, honey.

67
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,037
Can you get me
some ice cream with anchovies?

68
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,374
No, no, no.
You mustn't give in to your cravings.

69
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,418
It's not good for the baby.

70
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,339
You need to increase your spider intake,
so he'll be able to climb ceilings properly.

71
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,091
And eat lots of sheep bile.

72
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,679
I love you, Dad, but we don't even know
if the kid's gonna be a vampire.

73
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,682
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y,
just like Johnny.

74
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,144
"Human-y." With thousands of years
of Dracula genes.

75
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,437
Not gonna happen.

76
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,272
As long as the baby's healthy.

77
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,943
-Of course. A healthy little vampire.
-Or human.

78
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,779
Yes, a human who can fly as a bat.

79
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,907
Here. Just have some monster ball soup.

80
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,951
It's your mommy's recipe.

81
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,748
Thank you, Dad.

82
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,752
Just like you made it when I was a kid.
My favourite.

83
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,557
Sorry.

84
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,408
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

85
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,827
Really? I mean, okay.

86
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,162
He's the family, I guess.

87
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,796
Look! It's a boy! It's a boy!

88
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,883
The Dracula bloodline carries on!

89
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,012
No one will ever harm you
as long as I'm here,

90
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,847
my little devil dog.

91
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,016
Dad, can I hold my baby?

92
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,143
If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

93
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,854
But I'm the nurse, Francine.

94
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,647
Here you go anyway.

95
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,489
My bad.

96
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,163
Little Dennis is a year old now.

97
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,211
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

98
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,217
Okay, time for presents, guys.

99
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,012
All right! Let's do this boy up!

100
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,056
Check out what I got him. Bling!

101
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,141
Is it cursed?

102
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,268
Super cursed. Only the best.

103
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,103
Straight from the crypt.

104
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,316
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than...

105
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,862
You're okay, Denisovich.

106
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,615
His name is Dennis. Named after my father.

107
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,784
It's not his vampire name.

108
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,245
My little Denisovichy-Weesovichy.

109
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,997
Are we sure he's a vampire?

110
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,624
I mean, not that it's a bad thing,

111
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,920
but shouldn't he have fangs
and that pasty skin you guys have?

112
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,215
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

113
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,843
He'll get his fangs. He's a Dracula.

114
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,719
He's also half Loughran.

115
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,931
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

116
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:24,810
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

117
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,733
We have a present. I hope it's acceptable.

118
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,236
"My First Guillotine."

119
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,322
Very educational. Well played, Frank.

120
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,118
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby-proof that.

121
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,622
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

122
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,292
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

123
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,795
So you cut your finger off. It's part of the fun.

124
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,298
She made me baby-proof the whole hotel.

125
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,009
Someone's overprotective.

126
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,869
Johnny! Come quick!

127
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,915
What's up? He's okay?

128
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,958
Dennis said his first word!

129
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,502
He did?

130
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,712
Come on, honey. Say it again.

131
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,963
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

132
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,842
I don't say, "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

133
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,345
We didn't say you did.

134
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,847
-Then where did he get that?
-Bleh, bleh-bleh.

135
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,016
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

136
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,602
I only say it when I say I don't say it!

137
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,187
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

138
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,981
Okay, kid. We get it. You can talk.

139
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,276
Denisovich.

140
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,030
-Dad.
-Just checking for cavities.

141
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,161
-Bleh, bleh-bleh.
-Bleh, bleh-bleh.

142
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,288
It was you!

143
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,133
My goodness, Leonard.

144
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,804
If you really looked that hideous,
I don't think I could hang out with you.

145
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,389
Guys, what's the deal?

146
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,850
Is this a party? Pick up a phone.

147
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:33,230
I don't care if Johnny said it's a "cool app."
Johnny's still new here.

148
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,984
Now, Porridge Head,
did you call a hearse for the Gremlinbergs?

149
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,654
No, you're checking your Facebook page.
Again.

150
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,949
Drac, I told the guys social media
is the best way to promote the hotel.

151
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,576
Right, Clifton?

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,371
So, Drac, I wanted to go through
some thoughts I had,

153
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,499
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

154
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,667
Sure. It's a real job.

155
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,087
Not a cheap excuse to keep Mavis happy,
so you never leave here.

156
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,298
Right. So, I was thinking,

157
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,594
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

158
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,095
Like, maybe the magician?

159
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,972
What's wrong with Harry Three-Eye?

160
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,100
Well, he might be a little old-school
for the humans.

161
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,394
Tell me, sir, what was your card?

162
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,229
The three of spades?

163
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,442
Is this your card, my friend?

164
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,655
No, Harry's great.

165
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,116
Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

166
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,868
Okay, what about Wayne?

167
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,786
Wayne? Are you nuts? He's my boy.

168
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,580
Then maybe something other than tennis?

169
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,749
Okay, so, what you wanna do

170
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,753
is lift the racket right on impact,
so you get that nice top spin.

171
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,421
Try and hit one.

172
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,807
What is that? What's the noise? It's on me!

173
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,643
It's just the cell phone I got you.

174
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,979
Clifton's sending you a text
so you can practise how to write back.

175
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,611
-What the... It's not doing it.
-I got it.

176
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,117
Now you can text Clifton.

177
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,495
All right, fine.

178
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,123
-How do you do this?
-Maybe it's your fingernails.

179
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,626
It's easy. Look. I'll text Mavis.

180
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,212
Psyched for date night.

181
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,798
See? And now look, she texted right back.

182
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,342
"Gotta cancel. Can't leave Dennis."

183
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:26,885
Okay.

184
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:31,682
Are we never allowed to be alone again?

185
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,853
I need to feel loved, too.

186
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,396
And send.

187
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,608
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

188
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,069
Yeah, got it.
Maybe you should just get Bluetooth.

189
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,780
Okay. Blue Tooth, come over here.

190
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,993
So, now what?

191
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,749
Rise and shine, my Denisovich.

192
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,126
Hi, Papa.

193
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,671
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

194
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,508
I dreamed that I saw a stegosaurus.

195
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,052
And were you drinking his blood?

196
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,097
-No.
-Just throwing it out there.

197
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,434
-Hey! You want to do something cool?
-Yeah!

198
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:20,731
I'm going to teach you how to turn into a bat.
Like me.

199
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,900
-See?
-Cool.

200
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,902
Yes! Cool, like I said.

201
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,862
Now you try.

202
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,614
I'm a bat.

203
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,074
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

204
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,409
I'm a bat.

205
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,079
-I mean, a real bat.
-I'm a bat!

206
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:42,461
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

207
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,922
Try. Feel the bat.

208
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,759
Not a chicken.

209
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,763
What's that? The electric boogaloo?

210
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,558
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

211
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,992
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

212
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,787
He was sleep-dancing.

213
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,329
Come on, sweetie. Back to bed.

214
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,165
"Back to bed"? It's already after 8:00 p.m.

215
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,042
Don't you remember the new sleep schedule?

216
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,962
He's going to human classes half the day.

217
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,174
If he could just sleep till 2:00 a.m. tonight,
it'd be so great for him.

218
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:33,262
But, honeydeath, six of Wayne's wolf pups
are having a birthday party tonight.

219
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,013
You wouldn't want him to miss that.

220
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:39,309
Dad, I love the wolf pups,
but they're a little too rough for Dennis.

221
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:43,355
-"Too rough"?
-Haven't you noticed? Dennis is different.

222
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,525
What are you saying?
Denisovich shouldn't be around monsters?

223
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,653
I love monsters! Video! Video!

224
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,197
You wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

225
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,282
Yeah!

226
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,245
Who's the coolest monster?

227
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,872
Kakie!

228
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,041
Kakie one happy monster!

229
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,502
Kakie love cake! Yummy!

230
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,796
Tummy get a tummyache.

231
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,258
How is that a monster?

232
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,427
Have some cake, Wuzzlelumplebum.

233
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,264
Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.

234
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:22,060
"Shares"? Yes!
When I think monsters, I think "shares."

235
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,647
Now, let me tell you
what a real monster is, Denisovich.

236
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:30,027
Dad, please. He's practically five already.
Don't force it.

237
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,824
Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.

238
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:44,666
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder

239
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,960
Mommy, I'm too old for lullabies.

240
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,379
What? That's not how that one goes.

241
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,131
This is the way most people sing it.

242
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,425
"Most people"? What's wrong with...

243
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,845
Suffer, suffer, scream in pain

244
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,098
Blood is spilling from your brain

245
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,893
-Daddy.
-Come on. You know how I sang it to you.

246
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,396
Zombies gnaw you like a plum

247
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,942
Piercing cries and you succumb

248
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:15,072
Suffer, suffer, scream in pain

249
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:20,494
You will never breathe again

250
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,081
Still works.

251
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:51,149
Happy birthday, Wally, Wilson, Whoopi,
Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

252
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,612
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

253
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,323
I thought about what you said, Dad.

254
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:02,619
-Maybe I was being a little overprotective.
-Thank you, coffin cake.

255
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,163
Dennis! I love you! Zing!

256
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,456
Hi, Winnie.

257
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:10,169
I just love your yummy strawberry locks!
Zing, zing!

258
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,800
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

259
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,344
It's okay, Aunt Wanda. They're just playing.

260
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,390
Holy rabies! Limbo? I used to love that game!

261
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,977
-Get in there, Mavey.
-Really? But I'm a parent now.

262
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,980
-Show 'em how it's done.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

263
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,490
No way! A piñata?

264
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,871
Mavis, honey. That's for later.

265
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,166
We don't want the pups to have too much...

266
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,419
Candy!

267
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,215
Sugar.

268
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,557
I'm sorry. Did I start all that?

269
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,893
Don't worry.
There's a reason they call it a litter.

270
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,157
Dennis! Are you okay?

271
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,744
-I got a candy.
-Look! Your tooth came out.

272
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,372
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

273
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,208
Yes, indeed. Here comes the fang.

274
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,711
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

275
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,588
He's not a monster.

276
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,929
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

277
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:48,016
What's wrong with the classes we have here?
Like the kids' yoga?

278
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,271
Yoga!

279
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,523
This is Denisovich's home.

280
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,276
-I don't know, Dad.
-What don't you know?

281
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,904
Well, we've been talking about moving.

282
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,282
Somewhere safer for Dennis.

283
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,159
Maybe where Johnny grew up in California.

284
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:10,581
I'm sorry, but you can't just
make somebody something they're not.

285
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,419
-Come on, honey. We have to go.
-Zing, zing?

286
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,339
Mavey, wait. You can't mean that.

287
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,428
You're in on this? The leaving?

288
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,972
It's not definite at all.

289
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,473
It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

290
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,268
but until we do it, it's not definitized.

291
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:36,523
Did he just cover me with birdseed?

292
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,609
Yeah, he covered me.

293
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,330
Dad, it's not a fang.

294
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,875
Dad, I don't know
if it's the right place for Dennis.

295
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,293
Right, Johnny?

296
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,880
Hey, dudeman. It's not me. It's Mavey.

297
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:03,133
Hey, dudeman. I'm afraid to say anything.

298
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,677
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

299
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,013
Drac? Who you talkin' to?

300
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,641
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

301
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,477
What are you wiggin' out about, Drac?

302
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,647
The kids.
Mavey Wavey's saying she wants to leave.

303
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,650
She wants to leave? What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

304
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,110
He's making the hotel more human-y
for Dennis.

305
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,987
You know, seeing that he isn't a monster.

306
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,614
He is a monster!

307
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,032
He's just a late fanger.

308
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,159
And I could be a hand model.

309
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:33,997
Shut up! It's all that human-y stuff
that's confusing poor Denisovich.

310
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,460
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monster-y things.

311
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,170
I need a cape.

312
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,632
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

313
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:47,010
Man, if you could just get some alone time.

314
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,805
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

315
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:53,016
Alone time with Mavis.

316
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:59,106
Have they even had a vacation
since before they were married?

317
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,737
They're going to now. And so are we.
Frank, you're a genius.

318
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,965
We'll take Denisovich to all our old haunts.

319
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,135
Each of us will show him our skills.

320
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,723
Teach him how to be a monster.

321
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,519
And he'll be fanging it up in no time.

322
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,313
Boy turns five next week.

323
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,065
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

324
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,484
It ain't ain't happening, baby.

325
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,154
All he needs is time with his vampa.

326
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,865
-"Vampa"?
-Vampire grandpa.

327
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,117
Come on, man. That's obvious.

328
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:58,665
-Johnny. Come outside.
-What? Who is it?

329
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,585
It's your father-in-law. I need to talk to you.

330
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,421
What's up?

331
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,050
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

332
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,345
No problem-o.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

333
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,433
Can they stay?
I don't think they're ready to leave yet.

334
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,477
Come on. Go to your mother.

335
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,396
-Look, you want to stay here, right?
-Of course.

336
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,024
This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

337
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,569
I haven't felt this alive
since they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

338
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,448
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

339
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,743
Maybe it's a good idea
to take her to your hometown.

340
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,286
But remember...

341
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,790
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

342
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,125
the Aveeno moisturiser after every bath.

343
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,587
And then the shea butter
on his tush before his PJs

344
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,965
and then 20 minutes with the nebulizer

345
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,343
while I read
his Learning Factory Phonics book to him.

346
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:54,763
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

347
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:58,141
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

348
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,393
No, no, no.

349
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,061
You kids go to California,

350
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,939
and see if it's the right place
to raise Denisovich.

351
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,482
And you remember how to video chat?

352
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,694
Yes, yes. With the phone and the buttons
and the agony.

353
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:12,698
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

354
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:16,451
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

355
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,871
I'm just gonna miss him so much.

356
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,000
-I love you, Dennis.
-I love you, Mommy.

357
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,712
I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories
every night before bed.

358
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,131
You're the best. I love you, Dad.

359
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,012
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

360
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,683
-Love you, Drac.
-Yes. I love you, too.

361
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,395
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

362
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,023
-But not too happy, capisce?
-Got it.

363
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,567
Operation
"Just Keep Her Distracted and Happy,

364
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,196
"But Not Too Happy, Capisce,"
starts now. Cool?

365
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,822
Smiling on the outside.

366
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,033
-Will you hug my backpack?
-No.

367
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,249
Back to bed.

368
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,377
Yes, we'll get to the bed. We all love the bed.

369
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,172
But we're just gonna do one thing first.

370
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,302
Is it shorts weather where we're going?

371
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,305
I hope not. My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

372
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,432
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

373
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,935
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

374
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,269
Brother.

375
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,022
I'm gonna miss you so much.

376
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:31,568
You know, you have to be strong, honey.
Because what we have is unbreakable.

377
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,656
Babe, don't cry. Everyone's looking.

378
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,282
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

379
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,910
Just let him play it out, get it over with.

380
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:44,581
Okay, you two lovebirds.
Drink your champagne and let's get going.

381
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,334
Yeah. No, sure. Okay.

382
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,627
Cheers, babe.

383
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,297
You klutz.

384
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,593
-We can't say nothin' about this?
-No. We don't have time for zingers.

385
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,105
How do you click in the stupid car seat?

386
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,731
You gotta cut those nails, man.

387
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,942
We just strap our kids down with duct tape.

388
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:17,656
What's he doing here?

389
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,118
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

390
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,912
Blobby, there's no room. Sorry, man.

391
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,083
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

392
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,170
Fine, put him on the Rascal.
Let's just get going.

393
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,061
Where are we going, Papa Drac?

394
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,814
Denisovich, we're going to have
an adventure.

395
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,816
A monster-y adventure.

396
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,986
Monsters! We're gonna eat cake.

397
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,865
-What did he say?
-No. No cake on this monster trip.

398
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:04,328
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"Too much cake makes tummy ache.

399
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,497
"A monster always shares."

400
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,503
We may need more than a week.

401
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:15,589
Hey, you know who could fix the kid
in a snap? Vlad.

402
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,675
What? We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

403
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:23,680
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

404
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:28,268
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

405
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,855
Being scary. Right, guys?

406
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,570
Guys? Guys! What is wrong with you?

407
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,697
Come on. Everybody likes that song.

408
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:44,409
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

409
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,538
-Hey, what are you putting in?
-It's an audio book.

410
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,999
Bigfoot's life story. He reads it himself.

411
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,501
Chapter One.

412
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,870
This is gonna be so amazing.

413
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,415
Yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy.

414
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,918
-What?
-I wanna see everything you did growing up.

415
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,754
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

416
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,924
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

417
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,969
-Lemme just quickly call home.
-Don't do that.

418
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,847
It's only 1:00 a.m. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

419
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,058
Right. I'm just not used to
being away from him.

420
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,061
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your dad was so all over it.

421
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,272
I know. He's the best.

422
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,252
Right turn, here.

423
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,756
Denisovich, rise and shine.

424
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,800
Boys, this bringing back any memories?

425
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:27,304
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

426
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,974
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

427
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,570
-Nice how they built it up.
-Okay, out of the car.

428
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:48,992
Denisovich, you're going to see
every monster do his specialty.

429
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,996
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

430
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:58,085
-He's gonna say, "Boo."
-Yeah, I don't think "boos" ever work.

431
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,755
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

432
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,591
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

433
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,025
Yeah, guess it just depends on work.

434
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,195
Frankenstein!

435
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,281
Hey, how ya doin'?

436
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:30,701
You're awesome! Can we take a picture?
Is that okay?

437
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,120
Sure, okay. Little selfie action.

438
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,372
For real?

439
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,042
-Awesome! Thank you so much.
-Hey, have a great day.

440
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,711
Boo!

441
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,213
-He's adorable.
-He's adorable.

442
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,132
Adorable, yes.

443
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,468
Not scary, but "boo" is a start.

444
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,940
My birthday cake's
gonna have the coolest guy on it.

445
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,067
Let me guess. Kakie.

446
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:08,030
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

447
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,241
Really. And who is this very cool guy?

448
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,620
-Batman!
-Batman. Great.

449
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:18,081
You don't know anyone else
with a cape that's cool?

450
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,416
This is good. Stop here.

451
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,550
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

452
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,968
Denisovich, watch this.

453
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,304
-What?
-I told you, come on.

454
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:36,433
If we don't inspire Denisovich,
how's he going to find his inner monster?

455
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,353
-Who's in a monster?
-Nobody, just...

456
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,104
Here, have an avocado.

457
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:45,692
Your mommy says it's a good fat.
Whatever the heaven that means.

458
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,778
Listen, I'm not gonna
set monsters back again

459
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,280
just to make your grandkid like vampires.

460
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:53,283
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been...

461
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,956
What a cutie.

462
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,624
But kill him.

463
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,294
Great. You know I haven't done this in years.

464
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,256
We don't need to kill any more.
We have Pop-Tarts.

465
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,382
Denisovich, you're going to love this.

466
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:13,094
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours.

467
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,263
Wayne, go.

468
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,018
Man. I'm too old for this.

469
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,146
Okay, how's it go again?

470
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,315
No, no, wait. That's for the moon.

471
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,819
I growl. Right, here goes.

472
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,156
-Growl!
-Get it, boy.

473
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,414
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

474
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:46,503
Some werewolf.
Did you actually say the word "growl?"

475
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:49,672
-You're a werewussy.
-I said I was rusty.

476
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:54,094
-Gimme me that Frisbee.
-No! It's my Frisbee! I fetched it!

477
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,387
Give it to me! Give it back!

478
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,724
Give it over here! Give me that! Give it back!

479
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,064
He's fine. He's Blobby.

480
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:11,236
This place is so amazing and scenic.

481
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,864
-What do you wanna show me first?
-I don't know.

482
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,950
It's pretty, but there's really nothing to do
once it gets dark.

483
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,702
Wait. What's that place?

484
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,002
So, you're telling me that I can pick
between all these different kinds of chips?

485
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:28,754
Yes.

486
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,923
How do people decide?

487
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:35,719
Now what's that beautiful fountain of rubies?

488
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:40,557
-Johnny, have you tried this Slurpée?
-Not that quickly, hon.

489
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,269
It comes in 48 flavours.
We have to try them all.

490
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,815
I don't know if we have time.

491
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,944
Why? This place is open all night. Right, sir?

492
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:53,737
Yes.

493
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:58,575
Johnny, look.

494
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,120
They're making a TV show about this place
and we're the stars.

495
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,790
-Hello, world.
-Awesome.

496
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:08,877
It's totally awesome. You're so lucky, Kal.

497
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,380
Hello, world.

498
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,885
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

499
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,098
Excuse us. Do you know where someone
can get a bite around here?

500
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,226
Did you seriously just ask a vampire
where to get a bite?

501
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,104
Gosh. I didn't mean...
We're not from around here.

502
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,690
This is so embarrassing. Just keep going.

503
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,109
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

504
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,989
So, what do you want me to do now?

505
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,866
Denisovich, you won't believe it.

506
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:43,161
The mummy can crash through walls
and turn into a swarm of beetles

507
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,622
and put a curse on anyone.

508
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,792
-That sounds mean.
-It's fun mean. Okay.

509
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,127
So, check it out.

510
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,132
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

511
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,260
-Hit it!
-Sandstorm? It's been awhile.

512
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:02,681
-Not my problem. Do it. Say your little spell.
-Okay.

513
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:07,269
I got this.
Frank, Wayne, Griffin, just try not to faint.

514
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,667
My back.

515
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,136
Wait.

516
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,685
How cute!

517
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:59,321
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

518
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,705
Holy rabies! This looks like a blast.

519
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,873
I don't know, Mavey.

520
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:13,043
This can be pretty dangerous
if you don't know what you're doing.

521
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,878
Of course, I rock these bikes.

522
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,463
May I, little dude?

523
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,550
Check it out. Yeah.

524
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,094
This is how I rolled every summer.

525
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,651
I think I scratched it.

526
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:39,903
My turn.

527
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:43,448
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

528
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:45,659
Well, I'll give it a try.

529
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:27,284
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

530
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,162
-Your wife, Johnny.
-My wife. Even better.

531
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:34,208
That was sick, lady.
Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

532
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,459
Transylvania.

533
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,712
That's cool.
I have a cousin from Pennsylvania.

534
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,466
These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

535
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:46,470
-What an awesome place to raise a kid.
-To raise a kid?

536
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,305
I don't know about awesome.

537
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,308
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

538
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,143
Anyways, we should hit my folks' place.

539
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,354
-I said we'd be there by now.
-Sure.

540
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:59,983
Hey, it's after 3:00 in Transylvania.
I'm gonna check on Dennis, okay?

541
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,199
Chocolate cereal. Are you kidding me?

542
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:11,995
-It's okay, Drac. It's 'cause they love us.
-Yeah. Monsters are what's goin' on.

543
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,164
Yeah. You should embrace it like I did.

544
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,166
I've got a best-selling workout video.

545
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,002
Follow me, ladies. Right. And left.

546
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,755
No, girls. Watch me. You're not watching.

547
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,842
Here we go. And eight and seven and six...

548
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,301
That's not me, guys.

549
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:29,680
Come on, even Bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

550
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,357
No. No, no, no.

551
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,818
-It's Mavis.
-You gotta answer it.

552
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,364
-You're pushin' too hard. Lighter.
-All right!

553
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,576
Denisovich, wake up. Boy, he's out cold.

554
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,035
I got this.

555
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,957
-Dad, what took so long?
-What?

556
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,586
Nothing, Mavey.
We're all great here at the hotel.

557
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,546
Just doing hotel things.

558
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,382
-Sorry, can't handle your breath.
-I hear ya.

559
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,302
-How are you?
-We're having a blast.

560
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:12,055
We just went biking and mini-marting.
It's so fun here.

561
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,267
-Is Dennis okay?
-Of course.

562
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,896
-You want to see him?
-Yes. Yes, I do.

563
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,899
-Hi, baby. How are you?
-Mommy.

564
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,025
I happy.

565
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,946
-Hey, little dude.
-Why is he wearing sunglasses?

566
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,073
We were playing.

567
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,826
It's a superhero thing.

568
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,246
Cebause, I'm Sunglasses Man, to the rescue!

569
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,165
-Okay, take it down a notch.
-I'm flying.

570
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:43,003
-You sound funny.
-No, no, that's his Sunglasses Man voice.

571
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:46,965
Static. The signal is bad.
Mavis, are you there?

572
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,426
Yeah, I'm still...

573
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:54,431
-All right. I guess he's having fun.
-Of course he is.

574
00:41:56,558 --> 00:42:00,812
I nailed it with the Sunglasses Man.
Right off the top of my head.

575
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,773
I threw in a "cebause."
Did everyone see that?

576
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,484
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

577
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,737
She's biking and mini-marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

578
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,949
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

579
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,619
Okay, I may have taken a wrong turn
a few miles back.

580
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,663
-Don't get mad.
-What?

581
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,583
Someone turn on the navigator on this thing.

582
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,627
Look how light I touch it.

583
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,797
Please enter your destination.

584
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:30,676
Please. I am begging you.

585
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,556
Yeah, this is gonna be good, Denisovich.

586
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,350
Scary stuff, okay? It's in you.

587
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,186
We just gotta concentrate on the scary.

588
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,064
Papa Drac? Do you miss Grandma?

589
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,025
Miss Grandma? Sure, I do.

590
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:51,572
I miss her every day. She was my zing.

591
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,325
-Why do you ask?
-I don't know.

592
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:59,329
-Do you miss anybody?
-I miss Mommy and Daddy.

593
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,999
And who else? You miss that Winnie?

594
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,502
The pup who tackles you
and tries to lick you all the time?

595
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,713
Yeah, but we're just friends.

596
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,382
No, no, no. You're a Dracula.

597
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:14,178
You can't just be friends
with a cute, hairy number like Winnie.

598
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:20,058
Right turn, now! Here. You imbecile!

599
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:22,769
-Right. Turn, Griffin!
-Yes, Papa Drac.

600
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:31,904
Wait and see, fellas.
This kid'll be guzzling goat blood in no time.

601
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:35,866
You have arrived at your destination. Yes!

602
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,409
-Yes!
-Here we are.

603
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,120
It's the vampire summer camp
I went to as a kid.

604
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:44,875
-What's it, Camp Vamp?
-No. Who names their camp "Camp Vamp?"

605
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,336
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

606
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,149
You see, Denisovich?

607
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:13,111
This is where I learned
to catch mice and shapeshift.

608
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:17,324
And use my incredible powers and strength.
It's pretty cool.

609
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:18,492
Badminton.

610
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:25,916
Yes, I don't remember this badminting.

611
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,086
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

612
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,754
I'm Dana, the director.

613
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:33,590
We're sure excited
to have you legends visitin' us.

614
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,092
What can I do you for?

615
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:40,264
Well, I'm very interested
in sending my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

616
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:44,434
This little redheaded, non-fangy little guy?

617
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:48,313
They're in there. He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

618
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:52,484
Can you show us some of the drills,
like where they catch the mice?

619
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:56,071
Can do.
A-course now we call it Tee-Mousing.

620
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,042
So they don't have to catch the mice?

621
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:13,130
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

622
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:15,966
Come here.

623
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,011
It's right there! What's the matter with you?

624
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:22,097
Hokey-pokey.

625
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:28,395
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

626
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,814
I wanna fly like Papa.

627
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,239
Yeah. We're over here, now.

628
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,118
Had to scale it down. Insurance.

629
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:48,290
Help me. Help me. Help me.

630
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:52,127
Hokey-pokey. See ya at the campfire.

631
00:45:56,757 --> 00:46:00,511
-Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.
-Hey, gang.

632
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,347
Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

633
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:07,601
Look at all of this. So cool.

634
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,522
-I can't believe I'm actually here.
-Well, you are.

635
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:15,192
Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

636
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,360
Yeah.

637
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,862
-I'll do whatever you guys want.
-Good.

638
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,532
-'Cause I bought this pretty sunhat for you.
-Linda.

639
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,700
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

640
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:26,828
-We can deal with it later, Linda.
-Okay.

641
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,705
Come see.

642
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,041
I've set up your bedroom.

643
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:38,006
It's just like Transylvania.

644
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,593
Transylvania. That was a fun experience.

645
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:43,887
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

646
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,806
but I told him he was just being silly.

647
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,599
That was you, Linda.

648
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,476
There they are.

649
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,604
You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighbourhood,

650
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:54,648
so I thought I'd invite them over.

651
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:58,861
They might be nice for you guys to talk to
since you're thinkin' about moving here.

652
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,406
Hi, Caren. Hi, Pandragora.

653
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,408
-Welcome, Mavis.
-Hey, guys.

654
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,704
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

655
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:11,957
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

656
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,252
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,
but it toughens them up.

657
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,588
Hey, you guys. And this is Loretta.

658
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:21,049
-She's married to Paul, who's a werewolf.
-Excuse me?

659
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:24,803
Yes, I was telling Mavis about
the other monster-human couples in town.

660
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:29,057
-I am not a werewolf.
-I thought...

661
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:32,561
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

662
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:39,818
Vampires will be friends forever

663
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:43,947
Through the centuries together

664
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:48,285
Even in the brightest sunny weather

665
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:52,706
Vampires will be friends forever

666
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:56,168
Literally

667
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:59,755
Forever

668
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:07,054
Great job, vampires. Give yourselves a hug.

669
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,353
-We're going.
-What? Where?

670
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:21,985
Why are we doing this?

671
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,738
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

672
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,241
What happened to
Michael Row Your Corpse Ashore?

673
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:30,035
Or Old McWerewolf Had An Axe?

674
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,167
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

675
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:41,380
-Who's ready to fly?
-Me! Me! Like a superhero.

676
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,590
Better! Like a vampire!

677
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,843
This thing is rickety.

678
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:48,053
You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

679
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:52,015
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

680
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,686
-It's how I was taught.
-I wanna fly now!

681
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:59,189
Attabat. You know Papa's right here
if you need him.

682
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:02,234
-I can't watch this.
-Please don't.

683
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,903
Here we go!

684
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,829
-He's still not flying.
-He will.

685
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,541
-Still not.
-It'll happen.

686
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:21,420
-This is a tall tower.
-That's why it's good.

687
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,006
-You should get him.
-He's gonna fall to his death.

688
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,008
He's taking his time.

689
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,220
-Drac!
-I did that my first time.

690
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,764
He's getting too close to the ground!

691
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,517
You know what? He's not gonna fly.

692
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:49,072
I told you. Papa's always here for you.

693
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,657
Again! Again!

694
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,077
Dear. My devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

695
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,412
You mean to the papers?

696
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:59,041
I guess it was pretty cool,
but I'm not about getting press.

697
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:04,087
No, sir. I mean the authorities.
I can't not report child endangerment.

698
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:06,798
Listen to me. That was fun.

699
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,384
Your singing is child endangerment.

700
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,136
Should we go down and help him?

701
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,097
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

702
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:17,476
-We have to call the boy's mother.
-No, that ain't happening.

703
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:20,229
His mother's already nutsy koo koo!

704
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,439
I have to follow protocol.

705
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:26,235
You will not follow protocol.

706
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:28,737
I'm a vampire. I can't be hypnotised.

707
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:32,950
-Right.
-Now, please. Don't make me call the police.

708
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,035
No one's calling nobody!

709
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:42,209
-Fire!
-Stop, drop and roll. Stop, drop and roll.

710
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:43,669
Screaming's not helping!

711
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:54,388
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

712
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:55,973
Bad?

713
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:00,143
No. You're the best kid in the world.

714
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:03,480
We didn't start the fire. It was the tower.

715
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:08,443
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

716
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,987
Let's go, my hero.

717
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:12,990
Cebause I'm Batman! To the Batmobile!

718
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,867
Yes. To the...

719
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:28,547
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

720
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,843
-Why do I feel so weird here?
-No, hon. They're being weird.

721
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,137
I think they're just trying to help me.

722
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,849
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

723
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:42,144
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

724
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,937
Santa Cruz. But...

725
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:47,232
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

726
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:51,486
he won't be so freaky. Like me.

727
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:54,823
Are you nuts? Mavis, you're a blast.

728
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,743
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

729
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:02,289
If Dennis grows up to be just like you,
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

730
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,542
I love you, Johnnystein.

731
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:06,752
You know what?

732
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:09,922
As long as we're all together,
we'll be happy anywhere.

733
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,673
Even at the hotel.

734
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,218
Yes!

735
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:17,846
What are you doing?

736
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:22,893
Check out this video my friend sent me.
This kid is an awesome daredevil.

737
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:25,896
Dude!

738
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:28,023
-Did you get it?
-Wait! Is that Dennis?

739
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:31,902
No! Is it? No. It's just hard to see. But...

740
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,697
Just deleted it. So, it's gone.

741
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,335
What? It's Mavis. I'm not answering it.

742
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:52,422
Come on, Drac. You have to.

743
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,260
All right!

744
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:59,471
-Yes, honeybunch.
-Dad? Where are you?

745
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,684
We're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

746
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:06,770
-It's perfectly safe.
-What's that noise? Is that a siren?

747
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:10,399
Those are just some wailing banshees
checking in.

748
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,900
Quiet, you banshees.

749
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:14,778
We're trying to have
a perfectly safe cookout over here.

750
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,615
Mommy! I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

751
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,577
-Papa Drac just tried to teach me how to fly.
-Wait a minute. Is that the mother?

752
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,328
No. Static again.

753
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:26,039
I am coming back to the hotel right now.

754
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:30,794
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

755
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,631
-What's goin' on?
-We need to get home right away.

756
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,595
Okay. I'll go wake up my backpack.

757
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:41,054
Guys, we gotta move.

758
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:43,682
We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

759
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:45,517
Don't worry. I made a call.

760
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:58,113
I'm sorry, Blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

761
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,829
Hit it!

762
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:23,138
-Transylvania.
-You want to go where?

763
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,806
Transylvania. As soon as possible.

764
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:28,018
-We don't fly direct to Transylvania.
-You don't?

765
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:32,439
You can go to Bucharest, but you'll have to
switch planes in Chicago and then Zürich.

766
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:33,774
So, when would we get there?

767
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,152
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

768
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,701
So, two seats in coach?

769
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,036
No!

770
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:48,205
-No!
-Yes.

771
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,811
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

772
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,896
You're killing me, Blobby.

773
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:25,617
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

774
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,745
-Johnny! Not now!
-Okay. Maybe later.

775
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,421
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

776
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,131
Frank, blow.

777
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:49,558
Now!

778
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:15,626
How fun is this? Why are you laughing?
You like that?

779
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,668
Watch this.

780
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:32,684
-Now this is flying, Denisovich.
-Like a vampire.

781
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:39,191
That's my boy. Look at you go.

782
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,495
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

783
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:22,776
So, hey, when are you going
to get here already?

784
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,736
We've been waiting...

785
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,657
Give me my son.

786
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,243
We just went out for some avocados.

787
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:34,246
-Mommy! I flew!
-I saw.

788
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:38,792
Mother's already nutsy koo koo
Nutsy koo koo

789
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:40,460
-Koo koo
-Oh, dear. Oh, dear

790
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,379
Oh, my devil
I have to follow protocol

791
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,464
That ain't happening
That ain't happening

792
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:45,883
Mother's already

793
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,050
Koo koo

794
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,094
Koo koo

795
00:57:56,685 --> 00:58:00,105
I was worried Dennis wasn't safe
around other monsters.

796
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:03,233
Now I don't even feel like
he's safe around you.

797
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,028
-But I was just...
-What was it you said?

798
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:09,364
Human, monster, unicorn.
That it didn't matter?

799
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,575
Well, I just know his life would...

800
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:14,328
We'll have his birthday party
here on Wednesday.

801
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:15,746
Then we're moving.

802
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,999
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

803
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,627
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

804
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,755
But I don't think you've let them
into your heart.

805
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,927
I can do it. I can do it.

806
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,972
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

807
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,599
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

808
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:21,478
-Dennis? What are you doing, sweetie?
-Nothing.

809
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:24,523
Careful. Let me help you down from there.

810
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,942
Are you getting excited about your big party?

811
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:28,610
I guess so.

812
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,738
You know who's coming?
Daddy's whole family.

813
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:33,782
Grandpa Mike and Grandma Linda.

814
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:37,619
All your cousins and aunts and uncles
who love you so much.

815
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:41,790
And then they're gonna be with us
when we move to California.

816
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:46,503
Mommy, are we going away
cebause I'm not a monster?

817
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:50,132
What? No. Dennis, of course not.

818
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:52,551
It's just grown-up stuff.

819
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:55,387
Okay. But what about Papa Drac?

820
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,890
He's gonna be here all alone.

821
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,726
Papa Drac has to stay here to run the hotel.

822
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:03,645
But he'll visit us. And we'll visit him.

823
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,065
-Can we call him every night?
-Sure.

824
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,072
Awesome!

825
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:16,033
Hello. We're here.

826
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:23,373
The night brings Johnny's family here

827
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:28,295
To take away all that Drac holds dear

828
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,463
Welcome, welcome.

829
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,757
Hide your feelings

830
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,636
Keep them all inside

831
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,229
Dude, why do you wanna leave?
This place is out of control.

832
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:46,730
I don't wanna leave.

833
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:48,732
All these awesome freakazoids!

834
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:52,236
-So, who's the coolest monster?
-Kakie.

835
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,738
-Kakie.
-Kakie. What a wussbag.

836
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:58,575
Isn't it nice to have
the whole family together?

837
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,413
Mavis, do you have
any cousins or thingies in your family?

838
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,541
No. It's just been me and Dad.

839
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:08,252
I never did ask how you lost your mom.

840
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,587
She was killed by angry humans.

841
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:14,258
Awkward

842
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:18,262
-But there is my Grandpa Vlad.
-You have a grandpa?

843
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:21,682
Yeah. He'll be at the party. I invited him.

844
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,100
You invited him?

845
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:27,354
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

846
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:31,942
Sure. Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

847
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,194
Anybody have a wet wipe?

848
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:56,049
Holy rabies.
He finally invites me to something.

849
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,136
-He's got a grandkid?
-And he never told you?

850
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:03,599
Easy, Bela.
At least there's another vampire in the family.

851
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,476
It's at a hotel? Fancy schmancy.

852
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,646
Hotels are for humans!

853
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,613
Bela, shut your blood hole.
Look what you started.

854
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:19,072
Don't worry, gang.

855
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:22,910
I raised my son to hate and kill
and steal the souls of humans

856
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,494
like a good boy.

857
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,998
Yes, Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

858
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,961
when he sees the big masquerade party
Johnny and I have planned.

859
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,171
What?

860
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:40,594
-Play along. It's my dad.
-You have a dad? That's funny.

861
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:43,388
Listen to me.
My dad cannot know you're a human.

862
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,432
Or any of your family.

863
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,851
What? But, Drac, I'm proud that we're...

864
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:51,021
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

865
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:54,858
That's right, gang.

866
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,403
We're gonna make the birthday
a monster masquerade party.

867
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,864
-Really?
-That's lovely.

868
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:05,661
Sort of like a last hurrah
before Dennis gets to be with normal people.

869
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:08,163
I couldn't have said it better.

870
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:31,144
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

871
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:39,069
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

872
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,029
Let's go, my hero.

873
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:42,781
Cebause I'm Batman!

874
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,951
Yes! To the Batmobile!

875
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,584
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

876
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:58,922
Yeah. Whatever. I'm not about to cry.

877
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:05,512
Hotel Transylvania.

878
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,224
I smell humans!

879
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,768
Tear it down!

880
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:16,565
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

881
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:20,277
You know what? Just wait outside for me.
This is family stuff.

882
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,945
You'll only get in the way.

883
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,947
I just wanna meet the little fanger.

884
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:27,117
-He should know his great-vampa.
-His what?

885
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:30,829
Vampire grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

886
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:34,750
Amazing party!

887
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,461
So, what do you think?

888
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,255
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

889
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:41,507
I ordered it online.

890
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,509
It was the only place
that delivered overnight.

891
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:45,969
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

892
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:50,057
Have you at least practised your voice?
You can't just talk like a hippie.

893
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,810
-I'm not a hippie. I'm a slacker.
-Talk like a vampire.

894
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:59,483
My name is Count Jonafang. I am a vampire.

895
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:03,487
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

896
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:08,033
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

897
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,827
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

898
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,163
Yeah, listen, if you think I don't like it,

899
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:17,000
you definitely don't want to say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh," in front of my father.

900
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:20,337
-Sir, Master Kakie has arrived.
-Hey.

901
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,298
Drac, this is Brandon, a.k.a. Kakie.

902
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,342
-We got him for Dennis.
-Hey, man.

903
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:27,177
Nauseated to meet you.

904
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:30,055
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

905
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:36,353
All right. Where's my vampson?

906
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:42,150
Please. Still has to make a dramatic entrance.

907
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:47,030
-Dad! Look at you!
-So you run a hotel now?

908
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:50,784
From Prince of Darkness
to King of Room Service.

909
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:55,247
Yes. So good to see you.
I'll be right with you.

910
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:03,380
Keep Vlad away from the humans and Mavis.

911
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,424
I'm on it.

912
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:09,428
Now that is a neat costume.

913
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:13,849
-These two smell funny.
-You're European.

914
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,226
It's called deodorant.

915
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:19,521
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

916
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,565
Hey, Count! How goes it? Frankenstein.

917
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:23,734
Actually, I'm technically
Frankenstein's monster.

918
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:25,235
Frankenstein, he's the doctor who...

919
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:28,238
Would love to hear more. Call my people.

920
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:31,158
So, let me introduce you
to some of your son's other buddies.

921
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:35,495
-This is Murray.
-Please don't kill me!

922
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:38,415
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

923
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:41,585
Talking toilet paper. Well, that's a new one.

924
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:45,088
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

925
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,507
Johnny!

926
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:52,095
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

927
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:55,933
I am Count Jonafang.

928
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,393
Bleh, bleh, black sheep.

929
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:01,438
Have you any wool?

930
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,273
What's that thing on your head?

931
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:05,859
Looks like my grandmother's boobies.

932
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:10,447
Daddy, who's the man with the funny face?

933
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:13,116
-Is this the kid?
-It sure is.

934
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:14,785
Let me see those fangs.

935
01:07:14,826 --> 01:07:15,953
What are you doin'?

936
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,454
I just love him so much.

937
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,124
I want to hug him right in the fangs
that he has.

938
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,839
I repeat, lemme see those fangs.

939
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:39,184
He's a late fanger, just like you.

940
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,937
Yes. Yes. Just like me.

941
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:46,567
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

942
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,152
-Yes, yes, I was.
-Used to pee in his bed.

943
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:50,487
Okay, Dad.

944
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:53,490
We just need to
scare the fangs out of the kid.

945
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:54,992
Hare ha hangs?

946
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,744
Yeah, it's what I did for Mr Tough Guy here.

947
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:02,791
First, you've got to possess something
the late fanger finds sweet and innocent.

948
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,169
Then you show them what's what and...

949
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:10,465
Trust me. It'll scare the fangs right out.
Right, Drac?

950
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:14,553
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the book fair,
I'll miss the street fair.

951
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:16,763
That's your guy.

952
01:08:17,346 --> 01:08:20,267
Possessed? But Dennis will be so upset.

953
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,352
Don't you get it? This is our ticket.

954
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:25,522
If it works for Denisovich, boom!
He's a vampire.

955
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:29,234
-And you all get to stay here.
-All right. All right.

956
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:31,778
-Capisce.
-Good call.

957
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:34,865
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

958
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,533
Dennis has a big surprise for you.

959
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:41,872
The one and only Kakie, The Cake Monster!

960
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:45,542
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

961
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:49,254
What a wonderful Kakie day it is!

962
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:53,591
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

963
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:00,057
Rise!

964
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:11,068
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

965
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,903
This isn't working for me.

966
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,578
Scary, Denisovich? You feeling anything?
Any change?

967
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:24,247
Is Kakie okay?

968
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:30,420
I want all the cake. Sharing is for cowards.

969
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,343
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

970
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:39,470
I think I saw it on a Blu-ray disc, bonus stuff.

971
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:41,723
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

972
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,024
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

973
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:58,824
You don't eat cake. Cake eat you!

974
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:01,785
-No!
-Stop it!

975
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,624
What just happened, man? I'm outta here.

976
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,878
None of these parents
better review this on Yelp.

977
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:12,546
Hey, what did you just do?

978
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:15,465
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would have popped right out.

979
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:19,052
-I don't care. It's not worth it.
-What's not worth it?

980
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:22,598
It was my last attempt
to make the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

981
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:25,809
By ruining his favourite thing?
How could you do that?

982
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:26,977
We were desperate.

983
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:30,397
-You were in on this?
-Dennis won't be happy in my town.

984
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,232
Dennis hasn't been there.

985
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,276
Now husband and wife

986
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:36,653
Feel the strain and the strife

987
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,322
Shut up!

988
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,991
Johnny, Dennis is not a monster.

989
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,746
-He likes avocado.
-'Cause you don't let him eat anything fun.

990
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,915
I think Dennis just wants to be normal.

991
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,459
Can we stop using the word "normal"?

992
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,669
Where we live now, he's normal.

993
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:56,924
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

994
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:02,679
-Dennis, where are you going?
-Away.

995
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:06,475
But it's not safe out here by yourself.

996
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:09,937
I know a place where we can hide. Follow me.

997
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,236
If you didn't stop me,

998
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:20,656
my great-grandson wouldn't have to be
a wimp his whole life

999
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,282
like Schlumpy over here.

1000
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,368
-A wimp?
-Johnny, be cool.

1001
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:26,370
You wanna throw down, old man?

1002
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:30,249
-Certified yellow belt since 1997.
-No!

1003
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:34,878
-What's this now? You're not a vampire?
-Bleh?

1004
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,591
Of course he's human. He's our son.
You think we're monsters?

1005
01:11:42,553 --> 01:11:47,558
You! You let your daughter marry a human
and have a human kid?

1006
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:50,769
Why don't you just
put a stake through my heart.

1007
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:54,314
We don't hate humans any more,
and they don't hate us.

1008
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:00,153
Humans?

1009
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:02,489
You're a fool.

1010
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:08,078
Your great-grandson is the sweetest, kindest,
most special boy I've ever met.

1011
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:12,082
And if you can't give him the love
he deserves because he's half-human,

1012
01:12:12,165 --> 01:12:13,792
then you're the fool.

1013
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:16,253
Daddy.

1014
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:22,092
-Hey, where is Dennis? Dennis!
-Dennis?

1015
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:28,348
Happy birthday, Dennis. I made you a treat.

1016
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:30,225
-Dead pigeon?
-Enjoy it.

1017
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:33,228
'Cause once I graduate business school
and start running a company,

1018
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,273
you're not gonna get home-cooked meals
like this any more.

1019
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:39,902
I have to move away, Winnie. To California.

1020
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:45,199
My mommy thinks I'm not happy here
cebause I don't have hair on my face like you.

1021
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,451
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

1022
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:51,038
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

1023
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:55,209
-And I have 300 brothers.
-You're nice, too, Winnie.

1024
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:04,718
Well, well, well. The little human and his pet.

1025
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:06,762
-Dennis!
-Denisovich!

1026
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:09,181
-He's not in the room.
-He's not by the pool.

1027
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:13,060
-He's not in this pot of soup.
-Where could he be?

1028
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:15,812
I don't know why I ever invited you.

1029
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,898
-Dennis!
-Dennis!

1030
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:20,234
-Denisovich!
-Dennis!

1031
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,289
Stop squirming.

1032
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:38,335
-Why are you doing this?
-Because this is wrong.

1033
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,587
Why doesn't anybody get that?

1034
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:43,841
Humans don't belong with monsters.

1035
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:46,760
-You're wrong!
-I am not!

1036
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:49,346
I am holding you hostage.

1037
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:54,852
And me and my crew are gonna
tear that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

1038
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:58,230
-You can't.
-Really? Why not?

1039
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,899
-Cebause...
-Cebause, why?

1040
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:04,194
Cebause it will make Papa Drac sad.

1041
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:10,701
-Sad. And what are you gonna do about it?
-I don't know.

1042
01:14:10,784 --> 01:14:12,578
You know why you don't know?

1043
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:16,957
Cebause you're just a weak little boy.

1044
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:48,572
What was that?

1045
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,741
Dennis, we're coming.

1046
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:55,579
-Are you okay, Winnie?
-Yes, my zing.

1047
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:34,326
-Dennis! There he is, right there.
-Dennis! Baby!

1048
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:37,204
-My big boy!
-Dennis, we were lookin' for ya.

1049
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,540
-Sweetheart.
-I'm so happy to see you.

1050
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,962
There's his mean friends.

1051
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,679
This'll be fun.

1052
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:55,782
I didn't do that.

1053
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:10,297
-You rock, Dennis.
-He means Denisovich.

1054
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,715
Kakie rules!

1055
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:23,936
Dennis, I'm coming.

1056
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:31,318
I knew all that practise would pay off.

1057
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:57,678
That's right, you better fly away.

1058
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:02,724
Papa Drac, I'm a vampire and a superhero.

1059
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,351
Am I cool now?

1060
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:07,938
"Now"? Dennis, you were always cool.

1061
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:12,609
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

1062
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:16,613
But since I'm a vampire, can we stay here?

1063
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:18,323
Yes.

1064
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,951
-All right! Yeah!
-All right!

1065
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:27,124
But you have to know,
we're going to visit you here every holiday.

1066
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:29,251
-That's fine.
-That's fine.

1067
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:49,146
Don't ever come near me or my family again.

1068
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:53,734
No!

1069
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:06,330
Daddy, you just saved a human.

1070
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:11,335
All this pressure about
when the boy's fangs were coming out.

1071
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:15,631
Who cares? Mine came out years ago! Look.

1072
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:19,760
Okay, Dad, put 'em back in before we all barf.

1073
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:23,722
Hey! Isn't it still somebody's birthday?

1074
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:21,572
Let me hear you sing!

1075
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:24,992
I didn't do that.
